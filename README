How to operate the LocTite EQCL25 as given:

- It requires a MOXA NPort 5150, a normal RS-232 female/female modem,
  and an ethernet cable.  The LocTite machine will also need 
  the associated LocTite LEDs.

- The MOXA NPort 5150 uses IP address 192.168.127.254. 
  By default, port 4001 will be used to talk to the LocTite.
  The LocTite machine is also controllable through telnet
  by connecting to the IP address 192.168.127.254, port 4001.

- 1. Configure the MOXA NPort 5150 to have 38400 Baud rate,
  data length 8, 1 stop bit, and no flow control under Serial Settings. 
  
  2. Put the MOXA NPort 5150 in TCP Client Mode, with no packing length,
  no delimiter usage, and no force transmit in Operating Settings.

  3. The rest of the settings can be the same.

  Configuring these settings is also available through telnet
  by connecting to the IP address 192.168.127.254.



Then the LocTite EQCL25 should work.

The intensity is given as a percent. It can go high as 255%.
However, it is not more powerful than 100%. Anything higher than
255% will not changet the intensity percentage and will cause 
an unseen error.

The irradiation time is given as an entered number * 0.1 s
and can go as high as 9990.  However, entering 9999 means 
the irradiation is continuous.  Entering anything other than
0-9990 or 9999 will not change irradiation.

The default temperature for the irradiation is degrees Celsius.

|The LocTite takes one group of LEDs,      | 
|makes them irradiate,                     |
|and upon turning the lights off and       |
|unselecting a channel, all channels become|
|unselected.                               |

To silence the machine except for error messages, 
connect through telnet to the LocTite machine and type in:
"<02#WDD0872408724FEFF**",
"<02#WDD08739087394000**"

To unsilence the machine, connect through telnet 
to the LocTite machine and type in:
"<02#WDD08724087240000**",
"<02#WDD08739087394000**"
